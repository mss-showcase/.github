## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the MSS Showcase GitHub Organization!

### About Me
I am building a modular, AWS-based microservice showcase project focused on stock market data processing and analysis. My project demonstrates best practices using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, EventBridge, API Gateway, and modern frontend technologies like React â€” all carefully optimized to run within the AWS Free Tier.

## Resources
- The [MSS Showcase GitHub org](https://github.com/mss-showcase) contains separate repositories for (github action + terraform) deploy scripts, configured a CloudFront Distribution (but that is too complex to configure and it is too , deploy much for this showcase - therefore I will switch to s3 static web hosting for now), Lambda functions, and a simple frontend app.
- My infrastructure is defined via Terraform with upsert workflows.
- The Lambdas are at now Node.js based, with GitHub Actions automating build and deploy pipelines.

## Where I am now?

As you can see the terraform scripts of the mss-infra project in this phase can reliably 

 * create the necessary buckets (for build and for data)
 * deploy each lambda to AWS
 * set up the correct roles, permissions and policies in AWS IAM for the lambdas
 * configure the AWS gateway
 * The webapp deployment - it required a new S3 bucket and static hosting (CloudFront configuration has been dropped for the sake of simplicity)

## TODOs

 * The mobile app - instead of the Expo app, a new mobile app will be created (technology to be decided)

## Give it a try!

You can try this webapp in AWS until approximately 2026.06.01, or until AWS starts charging for hostingâ€”whichever comes first.
